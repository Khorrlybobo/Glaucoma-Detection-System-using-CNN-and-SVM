of Oral Cancer using MobileNetV2**\n\n**Introduction:**\nOral cancer is a pressing global health issue, and early detection plays a vital role in improving patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a deep learning model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture for predicting oral cancer. Our goal is to leverage the strengths of deep learning and image analysis to develop an accurate and efficient tool for early oral cancer detection.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n\n**1) Dataset:**\n\n* We utilized a comprehensive dataset of oral cancer images, comprising two classes: \"cancer\" and \"non-cancer.\" The dataset was meticulously curated and labeled by medical professionals.\n\n\n**2) Data Preprocessing:**\n\n* To enhance the model's performance and prevent overfitting, we applied various data preprocessing techniques. These techniques included image augmentation methods such as rotation, shear, zoom, horizontal flip, and brightness adjustments. Additionally, we partitioned the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.\n\n\n**3) Model Architecture:**\n\n* We selected the MobileNetV2 architecture as our base model due to its efficiency and effectiveness in image classification tasks. MobileNetV2 is designed to provide a good trade-off between computational efficiency and model accuracy. We fine-tuned the architecture specifically for oral cancer detection by adding additional layers.\n\n\n**4) Training and Evaluation:**\n\n* The model was trained on the training set and evaluated on the validation set. We employed the Adam optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Throughout training, we monitored evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the model's performance.\n\n\n**5) Results:**\n\n* The trained MobileNetV2 model exhibited promising results in predicting oral cancer. We achieved an accuracy of 0.7749999761581421, precision of 0.782608687877655, recall of 0.97826087474823, and AUC of 0.69972825050354. These results indicate the model's ability to accurately classify oral cancer cases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn this study, we developed a deep learning model based on the MobileNetV2 architecture for predicting oral cancer. By harnessing MobileNetV2's efficiency and accuracy in image analysis, our model effectively extracts features from oral cancer images. This research contributes to the field of medical imaging and provides a potential tool for early detection of oral cancer. Further research and advancements can significantly impact the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
